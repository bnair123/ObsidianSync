Activity 1: The ctype header file Search the internet for information on the C header file ctype.h. Which functions are useful when processing alphabetic characters? In your logbook, list the prototypes of these functions, and provide a short description of what they do.

Activity 2: Count letters in a string Open the provided dictionaries CMake project. This project contains two subprojects: letter_counter and word_counter. In the letter_counter directory, locate the function count_letters, and read its description (in letter_counter.h). The function takes an array freqs of (at least 26) unsigned longs and a null-terminated string (i.e., const char*) as its arguments. The function must update the freqs array by adding the counts of the letters in the string to it, and returns the total number of letters it counted. Counting is not case-sensitive. Remember to ignore all non-letter characters in str. Implement the function, and test it by running the code given below. To make your life easy, use the functions of the ctype.h header file. 1 unsigned long count_letters(unsigned long counts[static 26], const char* str)←- ; 2 3 int main(void){ 4 unsigned long counts[26] = {0}; 5 const char* text = "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog."; 6 unsigned long total = count_letters(&counts[0], text); 7 assert(35 == total); 8 printCounts(&counts[0], false, true); 9 } Make sure to test your code - after executing the above piece of code the printed counts (note that they are printed in order of decreasing frequency) must be the following:
• Character ’o’ appears four times, • Character ’e’ appears three times, • Characters ’t’, ’r’, ’u’, and ’h’ each appear two times, • All other characters appear exactly once.
